NB: This project is inspired by a repository by Viridiana Romero Martinez (which can be found here: https://github.com/viritaromero/Detecting-Depression-in-Tweets), to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the dataset and most of the code I used. This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Artificial Intelligence.
